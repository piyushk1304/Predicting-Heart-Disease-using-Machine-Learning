# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease based on clinical features using machine learning. The dataset contains various attributes like age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical data points that can help in predicting the target variable: whether or not the patient has heart disease.

# Project Overview

The problem is framed as a binary classification task. Given the medical characteristics of a patient, the model predicts if they have heart disease (1) or not (0).

# Key Topics Covered

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset, data visualization, and feature analysis.

**2. Model Training:** Building and training multiple machine learning models to predict heart disease.

**3. Model Evaluation:** Using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

**4. Model Comparison:** Comparing the performance of different models to find the best one.

**5. Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the model parameters for improved performance.

**6. Feature Importance:** Identifying which features have the most impact on the prediction of heart disease.

**7. Cross-Validation:** Testing the model's robustness by evaluating it on different subsets of data.

**8. Reporting and Visualization:** Summarizing the findings and presenting visualizations.
